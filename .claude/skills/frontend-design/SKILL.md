This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—intentionality matters most.

Implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

**Focus on:**

- **Typography**: Choose beautiful, unique fonts. Avoid generic options (Arial, Inter); opt for distinctive choices. Pair display fonts with refined body fonts.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to cohesive aesthetics. Use CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only for HTML; use Motion library for React. Orchestrate page loads with staggered reveals.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space or controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere with gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

**NEVER use**: Generic AI aesthetics like overused fonts, clichéd color schemes (purple gradients), predictable layouts, or cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimalist designs need precision and restraint. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
